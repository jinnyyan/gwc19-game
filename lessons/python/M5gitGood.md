# M5: gitGood
[04 NOV 2019]

## Review: What is git?
In which lesson did we introduce git? If you haven't read about it, look up what git is from the first reference link in that lesson.

## Create & locally clone your own repository
1. Open our CodeHoppers Windows 10 instructions at: https://github.com/jackg-ch/ch_labs/tree/23a11dcbde8fd251caefb013967566b97470aa91
1. If you don't already have git installed on your computer, follow the install instructions. The download site supports Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux/Unix operating system releases; the rest of our club's instructions are tailored for Windows 10 displays.
1. If you don't already have a github account, follow the instructions to create one. Login to your account.
1. Navigate to the https://github.com/new URL and name your new repository `codehoppers`. Make it public so you can share with the rest of the club and initialize with a README markdown file.
1. Follow the instructions to clone your new repository locally to your computer (steps 3-6). Since you named your repository `codehoppers`, you will change directory into that folder name.

## Add content to your repository
1. Create two new folders in your repository: `game` and `assignments`
    * You can use the File Explorer to create these with a GUI
    * You can use two commands from the command line inside of your codehoppers folder to create these quickly: `mkdir game` and `mkdir assignments`
1. Put copies of the club's python games into your game folder (`basicGame2019.py` and `functionGame2019.py`). Make another copy of one of these and name it `<LastName><FirstInit><MiddleInit>_2019game.py` (e.g. `RodriguezJM_2019game.py`).
1. Put a copy of your assignment 1 python code into the assignments folder.

## Commit to your repository and share
1. Follow 'Push Your Code up to GitHub' steps 4-8.
1. Refresh your web browser that is pointing at your repository (should be github.com/username/codehoppers) -- you should now see the code you just committed!
1. Navigate to your assignment 1 code and copy the URL (should look like https://github.com/<username>/codehoppers/blob/master/assignments/<filename>.py). Paste this URL back to your group's piazza assignment 1 post. 

## Looking ahead...
You're now all set up to work on and save your code from anywhere! Remember to configure and remove your git info from shared computers as per the instructions in lesson 1 (https://github.com/jinnyyan/gwc19-game/blob/master/lessons/python/M1git.md). You can start to work on tweaking the game in your own creative way under your named game file; we'll see some examples of creative games at meeting 7 (creative gaming). Save and commit often when updating your code.

If you have more time:
* Review the loops lesson: https://github.com/jinnyyan/gwc19-game/blob/master/lessons/python/M4loops.md
* Start working on your game -- if you want to start getting deeper, there's a pygame tutorial for tile-based games at https://qq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
