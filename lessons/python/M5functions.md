# M5: Core 4: Functions
[28 OCT 2019]

## What is a function?
**The computer can bundle commands and refer back to these bundles when you need them**
A function is a set of commands that produces a specific action. Some languages have built-in functions, such as `print( )` in Python, and move in Scratch. Most languages will also let programmers write their own functions. Programmers use functions to create a process that can easily be used and reused in their code, rather than writing out the process every time.
